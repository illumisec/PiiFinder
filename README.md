PII Finder
Author: @illumisec

This project is intended to provide a simple way of searching for Personally Identifiable Information (PII).

Select the directory structure you wish to search and PII Finder will search for:

* Email Addresses
* IP Addresses
* MAC Addresses
* Australian Tax File Numbers
* Credit Card Numbers (Visa, MC, AMEX, Diners)
* Australian Passport Numbers
* Australian Phone Numbers



I would like to see the range PII expand and become selectable.


The current output is a .csv file containing a breakdown of each file searched.
